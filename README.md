This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

I created a youtube guide showing how to create this project.

This is a copy of this movie:

but i made it in a different way and added a few things myself.

The backend is fully copied.

## How to turn on?

1: Clone repo.
2: Run this few command in the console: - npm install - npm start.

    At this point you can add items to your basket.

3: If you want create an order and pay for it, you have to turn on firebase backend in the console: firebase emulators:start

    Firebase is linked to my test account, which gives you the opportunity to place orders.

    In place of the card number, keep 42...
